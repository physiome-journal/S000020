    Reproducibility Study for a Computational Model of the Neurovascular
    Coupling Unit
  description: >-
    The mechanistic model of neurovascular coupling was developed and studied by
    Sten et al. (2020). This model describes and predicts the arteriolar
    dilation data of mice under various stimulations while anaesthetised and
    awake. We reconstructed the model in CellML, using a modular approach for
    each neuronal pathway, and successfully reproduced the original experiments.
